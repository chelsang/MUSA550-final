## Indego Trip Distribution

For a better understanding of the scale of this project, the time-lapse GIF below shows how trips change overtime from January 2018 to September 2020.<br>

According to this GIF image, bikeshare trips mostly concentrate in Center City and its surrounding neighborhoods, following the same trend as the geographic distribution of the Indego stations. There was a significant trip reduction after 2018 Quarter 2, since the city introduced a new [pricing system](https://www.phila.gov/2018-03-12-indego-bike-share-announces-new-pass-options-and-pricing-adjustments/) in March 2018 and the city was facing the [wettest fall season](https://bicyclecoalition.org/2019-fall-bike-counts-show-bicycling-was-increasing-before-covid-19/) on record. The number of trips went back up as the weather warmed up and [electric bikes were introduced](https://www.phila.gov/2019-05-02-indego-announces-expansion-of-its-electric-bike-fleet-new-stations/).

Similarly, there was a slight trip reduction in 2019 Quarter 4 and 2020 Quarter 1 as the weather changed. However, the citywide lockdown due to COVID-19 since 2020 Quarter 2 did not affected bikeshare trips significantly. It might be that cycling provided an alternative to riding public transportation for people who need to hop on essential trips. Alternatively, it is also possible that people find biking to be a way of exercising while maintaining social distance. The graphic also shows a trend that people were also taking longer trips in 2020 Q2-Q3 compared to 2019 Q2-Q3.
