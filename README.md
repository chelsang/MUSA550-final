# Evaluation of Indego Bikeshare Trip Generation 

**Chen (Chelsea) Zhang**

**MUSA 550 Final Project <br>
December 21, 2020**


This project studies how Indego bikeshare stations are connected to nearby facilities and runs a machine learning model that simulates the bikeshare trip generation prediction process. Accuracy of the model is limited due to the scope of this project, but policy recommendations can be derived to guide future Indego station implementation.


In all, this project is carried out into 4 parts:

* Temporal Spacial Distribution of Bikeshare Trips
	- Temporal Change Illustrated in a Datashader Map
* Exploratory Analysis of Indego Stations 
	- Distance from Nearby Facilities to Indego Stations
* Data Preparation for Prediction Model
	- Variable Selection and Correlation Testing
* Predicting Bikeshare Trip Generation
	- Constructing Sci-kit Learn Machine Learning Model
